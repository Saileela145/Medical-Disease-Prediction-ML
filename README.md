# Medical Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of a medical disease using supervised machine learning algorithms. Early disease prediction helps in preventive healthcare and decision support for doctors.

## 🧠 Type of Learning
Supervised Machine Learning

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, and other health-related features.  
Target variable indicates whether the patient has the disease (Yes / No).

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naïve Bayes

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

> Recall is given high importance as missing a diseased patient can be critical.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 🎯 Objective
To compare multiple classification algorithms and identify the best-performing model for medical disease prediction while addressing overfitting and bias-variance trade-off.

## 📌 Conclusion
Random Forest performed better compared to individual classifiers by reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Use larger real-world medical datasets
- Deploy the model as a web application
- Add more advanced machine learning models
